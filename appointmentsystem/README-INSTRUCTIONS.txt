				!PLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS ON DOCTORS SIGNIN IN!		
				
*******************************
-- create a database named "appointment_db" in phpMyAdmin
-- then import the file "appointment_db.sql" to run the database
-- save the folder named "Appointment" inside htdocs folder of your XAMPP
*****************
--The database has pre-data given especially the doctors table since doctors data cannot be changed on the website itself for
	security purposes

* LOGGING IN AND SIGNING UP AS USER
	-- fill in all the fields as required

* LOGGING IN AS DOCTOR
	-- To login as a doctor, You must enter the full name of the doctor WITH 
		"Dr. " at the beggining 

	EXAMPLE: 
		username: Dr. Ramil Torres  
		
	-- For the password, simply put his surname in all LOWERCASE
	
	EXAMPLE: 
		username: Dr. Ramil Torres  
		password: torres

	-- The list of doctor are as follows:
		Dr. Janella Reyes
		Dr. Jasmine Santos
		Dr. Rowena Reyes
		Dr. Maricar Cruz
		Dr. Christian Ocampo
		Dr. Gabriel Santos
		Dr. Jessica Smith
		Dr. Danilo Garcia
		Dr. Ramil Torres

-- The Information that is also pre-given to the doctors are "Lorem Ipsum" because i do not know what to include
-- But, they can edit their information afterwards

-- You cannot signup as a doctor so that other users wont be able to sign up as doctors as well
	(because they wont be able to see on the website) if they suddenly decided to.
 
--This also helps doctors the hassle for signing up as they are busy
